# Solana
https://solana.com/

Solana is a decentralized blockchain that has fast transactions per seconds with very small gas fees (a fee that is imposed whenever performing transactions on the blockchain, typically this is the cut that the node receives whenever they perform the transaction).

Solana forever promises gas fees that are less than $0.01 every transaction, which is why it's such a popular blockchain. It's one of the most
popular ecosystems to develop on because of its cheap and fast blockchain for DeFi (decentralized finance), NFTs (non-fungible tokens), Web3, etc.

### Solana Programs
A solana program is like a "smart contract" in Etherum. It's a piece of code that lives on the blockchain, and that code is ran for a small
fee as part of a transaction. The code is not ran by a big corporation like Amazon or Google, but instead it's decentralized because it's run by "miners" also called "validators" on Solana.

Solana programs are stateless, unlike Etherum which stores variables on the smart contracts themselves. Instead, Solana uses "accounts" and these programs interact with the accounts to store data.

### Solana Accounts
An account is sort of like a file, such as how users can have many files and developers can write programs that talk to these files. The account will hold the user's data, and users can have multiple accounts. A single user can have even thousands of accounts!

### Cross-chain
There are so many blockchains that exist now (Bitcoin, Etherum, Solana, etc.), so we have many chains each with their own specialties! This makes it so there is no monopoly of a blockchain, but this also means that currently there is no way we can talk to each other right now.

Fortunately, a solution is appearing that provides bridges between blockchains: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-bridges

This means you can buy an NFT on Etherum and move it to Solana if you wanted.
